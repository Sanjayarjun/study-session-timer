Smart Study Session Timer - MVP Plan
This plan outlines the creation of a simple, terminal-based Pomodoro-style timer.

Files to Create/Modify:
app.py:

This will be the main script for the application.
It will contain a function to run a work session timer (e.g., 25 minutes).
It will include a function for a short break timer (e.g., 5 minutes).
A main loop will orchestrate the sessions, alternating between work and breaks.
The script will print status messages to the terminal to keep the user informed.
requirements.txt:

This file will be updated to remove the streamlit dependency as it is not needed for this terminal application. For the beginner version, no external libraries are required.
