# Project Summary
The Smart Study Session Timer is a productivity application designed to enhance time management for students and professionals. It functions as a Pomodoro timer, enabling users to set study/work sessions while tracking time and providing break reminders. The application also generates daily statistics on total study time, average focus time per session, and subjects/topics studied, ultimately aiming to improve focus and efficiency for users.

# Project Module Description
- **Main Application Logic**: The core functionality is implemented in `app.py`, which manages the timer and session reminders.
- **Configuration and Requirements**: The `requirements.txt` file specifies necessary packages, while `template_config.json` serves as a placeholder for future configurations.
